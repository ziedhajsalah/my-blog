# FlexBox Course

## Introduction

    The flex box model is composed of two type of elements: The flex container (or the parent element) and the flex items (or children elements).
    An element becomes a flex container by adding a css property `display: flex` to it.

## Parent Element

    The flex container properties:

        - `flex-direction`: defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
            - `row` (default)
            - `column`
            - `row-reverse`
            - `column-reverse`
        - `flex-wrap`: specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
            - `no-wrap` (default)
            - `wrap` elements will wrap if needed
            - `wrap-reverse` elements will wrap if needed in reverse order.
        - `flex-flow`: shorthand property for setting both the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties.
        - `justify-content`: used to align the flex items horizontally.
            - `flex-start` (default)
            - `flex-end`
            - `center`
            - `space-around`
            - `space-between`
        - `align-items`: used to align the flex items vertically.
            - `stretch` (default): fill the container.
            - `flex-start`: top of the container.
            - `flex-en`: bottom of the container.
            - `center`: middle of the container.
            - `baseline`: baselines of the items.
        - `align-content`: used to align the flex lines.
            - `stretch`: take the remaining space 
            - `space-between`: have equal spaces between lines.
            - `space-around`: have spaces before/between/after line.
            - `center`: lines in the middle of the container.
            - `flex-start`: top of the container 
            - `flex-end`: bottom of the container

## Child elements

    The flex items properties:
        - `order`: specifies the order of the element. Default value is 0, means the elements are ordered like their order in the DOM.
        - `flex-grow`: specifies how much an item will grow relative to the other items. Default value is 0.
        - `flex-shrink`: specifies how much an item will shrink relative to the other items. Default value is 1. Value 0 means donâ€™t shrink.
        - `flex-basis`: specifies the length (width or height following flex direction) of the item.
        - `flex`: shorthand for `flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis`.
        - `align-self`: overrides the alignment specified in the container for `align-items` for the corresponding item
